              <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
                <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 01/01/2025 <br>

                <p>Welcome to <strong>Pick and Pose</strong>. By purchasing, downloading, or using Pick and Pose ("the Software"), you agree to be bound by the following Terms and Conditions ("Terms").</p>

                <h2>0. License Scope</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>License has an electronic delivery, and license delivery is prompt after the purchase has been processed.</li>
                    <li>Licenses are <strong>individual and non-transferable</strong>. For team/group licensing, contact us at <a href="mailto:support@pickandpose.com">support@pickandpose.com</a>.</li>
                    <li>License validity is checked periodically in the background without affecting user experience. Internet connection is required. If it fails to check, the app will be locked.</li>
                    <li>We offer a one-month trial license during launch. We do not guarantee its availability beyond this period.</li>
                    <li>Any resale, sublicensing (e.g., embedding the app in another product) is not permitted without written permission.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>1. License Types and Usage Limits</h2>
                <p>Available license types:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Monthly License</strong> (auto-renews)</li>
                <li><strong>Two-Month Pass</strong></li>
                <li><strong>One-Time License</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Each license allows usage on up to <strong>4 devices or browsers</strong> simultaneously. Keys are stored in browser local storage. If you activate license key in two browsers on one machine that still counts as two machines.</p>
                <p>Licenses can be deactivated within the app. If all slots are used and cannot be deactivated, the license is considered <strong>lost</strong> and a new one must be purchased.</p>

                <h2>2. One-Time Licenses</h2>
                <p>The One-Time license and Two-Month Pass are <strong>one-time payments</strong>. These licenses do not auto-renew.</p>
                <p>The Two-Month Pass must be manually purchased again if you wish to continue using the app after it expires.</p>
                <p>The One-Time License is valid for a lifetime.</p>

                <h2>3. Subscription and Billing</h2>
                <p>The Monthly License <strong>renews automatically</strong> each month.</p>
                <p>Subscriptions can be managed or canceled via the Lemon Squeezy portal accessible from your confirmation email under "View Subscriptions".</p>

                <h2>4. Refunds and Chargebacks</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Full refunds available within <strong>30 days</strong> of purchase.</li>
                    <li>If a chargeback is issued, the license will be <strong>permanently revoked</strong>.</li>
